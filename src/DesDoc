Linear Equation Class
instance variables:
firstX -> x coordinate of the first point
secondX -> x coordinate of the 2nd point
firstY -> y coordinate of the first point
secondY -> y coordinate of the 2nd point, value will be determined by user, applies to the 3 variables above too


constructor:
public LinearEquation(int firstX, int firstY, int secondX, int secondY)
this.firstX = firstX
this.firstY = firstY
this.secondX = secondX
this.secondY = secondY


methods:
public String getSlope(int firstX, int firstY, int secondX, int secondY)
^will return secondY - firstY + "/" + secondX + firstX and set a slope variable to (secondY - firstY)/(secondX - firstX)
public String toString()
^will return the coordinates for both points, the slope of the line, the y intercept, the linear equation, and the distance between the points
public double getIntercept(slope, firstX, firstY)
^will return the y intercept
public double pointDistance(firstX, firstY, secondX, secondY)
^will return the distance between the 2 points
public double findY(thirdX, slope)
^thirdX will be set to the users input, and the method will then find the y coordinate .




EquationRunner
1: user inputs the xy coordinate for the first point
2: first x set to substring 1 to str.indexOf(",")
3: first y set to substring str.indexOf(",")
4.5: user inputs the xy coordinate for the second point
4: second x set to substring 1 to str2.indexOf(",")
5: second y set to substring str2.indexOf (",")
6:calculate slope with the getSlope method
7:calculate y intercept with the getIntercept method
8:calculate distance with the pointDistance method
9:display information with the toString method
10: third x is set to user input
11: calculate third y with findY
12: display third x and third y
13: everything can be rounded with the decimal format class
14: finish up by making print statements that look good
